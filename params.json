{"name":"Autotip","tagline":"Decentralized Cryptocurrency Microtipping Platform","body":"Autotip is:\r\n\r\n* An Open source Google Chrome extension.\r\n* Completely Decentralized. All tips move directly from tipper to tipee with no middleman.\r\n* Alternate way for content creators (bloggers, forums posters, artists) to monetize their content.\r\n* HTML5 standards compliant (official inclusion to the HTML standard is [pending](https://github.com/priestc/Autotip/issues/1)).\r\n* works for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Litecoin and many others.\r\n* is configurable to be sent automatically on each pageload, or only by prompt.\r\n\r\nThis project written for the Miami Bitcoin hackathon on January 9-10, 2015.\r\n\r\n## Setup for tippers\r\n\r\nSearch for Autotip in the chrome extension store. Once you've installed it, open up the\r\nextensions page by navigating to chrome:extensions:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8IkKdBK.png?1)\r\n\r\nNow click on the options link:\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/gximsVJ.png?1)\r\n\r\nYou'll see a deposit address near the bottom. Send a small amount of bitcoin to this\r\naddress. Less than $25 worth of bitcoin is recommended. This extension was not built with\r\nextreme security in mind, so it is advised to not hold large amounts in the extension.\r\n\r\n![screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/8ZOpWOk.png)\r\n\r\nOnce the bitcoins have been sent, you'll see the balance show below the private key.\r\n\r\nNow whenever you load a page that has been set up to use the Autotip standard,\r\nyour browser will automatically send a very small \"microtip\" (usually 5 cents or less)\r\nto the person who created the content on the page.\r\n\r\n## Setup for content creators\r\n\r\nLets say you're a blogger. You would like to earm money from the audience that reads your blogs.\r\nOne way to do this is to put ads on your site. Ads can be easily blocked, and for users\r\nwho don't block them, they are annoying to look at.\r\n\r\nGetting started using the platform is as easy as adding a snippet of code to every\r\npage that contains content.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the HTML document of your blog's header, you can add a meta take like this:\r\n\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"1HWpyFJ7N6rvFkq3ZCMiFnqM6hviNFmG5X\" data-currency='btc' data-recipient=\"John Doe\">\r\n\r\n(Replace the value of `content` with your actual bitcoin address. To get started with bitcoin, go to [bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/).\r\n\r\nYou can also use altcoin addresses:\r\n\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"Lb78JDGxMcih1gs3AirMeRW6jaG5V9hwFZ\" data-currency='ltc'>\r\n\r\n# Multiple tipping addresses per page\r\n\r\nThe standard also permits the use of multiple tip addresses. In the case that the extension finds\r\nmultiple tip addresses, the tip gets split amoung each address equally.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this extension does not support sending tips to altcoin addresses, but support is planned.\r\n\r\n# Full meta tag specification\r\n\r\nThe following attributes are associated with the meta tag specification:\r\n\r\n| attribute      | required | description |\r\n|----------------|----------|-------------|\r\n| name           | required | always \"microtip\"\r\n| content        | required | The private key of the cryptocurrency address of the person who will recieve tips.\r\n| data-currency  | optional | The name of the currency. Examples: `BTC`, `LTC`, also you can write the whole name of the curency, such as \"dogecoin\", and \"peercoin\". Case insensitive. If left blank, `btc` is implied.\r\n| data-recipient | optional | Human readable name of the person who will revieve the tips. Can be a person's name or just \"Development team\". The purpose of this field is to be shown to the tipping user at the time of making the tip.\r\n| data-ratio   |  optional | Only applicable if there are multiple microtip tags on a single page. This attribute tells the tiping extension how much of the tip should go to this address. The value should be a decimal number between 0 and 1.0.\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\nOne single Litecoin address, all going to the \"Development Team\" wallet address.\r\n\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"Lb78JDGxMcih1gs3AirMeRW6jaG5V9hwFZ\" data-currency='ltc' data-recipient=\"Development Team\">\r\n\r\nTwo different bitcoin address. Half going to Bob, the other half going to Terry. (Bitcoin currency is implied)\r\n\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"1HWpyFJ7N6rvFkq3ZCMiFnqM6hviNFmG5X\" data-recipient=\"Bob\">\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"1DCzzFuW33YJv9RGUMHyvgaoTdcNkwGMeR\" data-recipient=\"Terry\">\r\n\r\nSame as above, but 80% of all tips goes to Terry, 20% goes to Bob.\r\n\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"1HWpyFJ7N6rvFkq3ZCMiFnqM6hviNFmG5X\" data-recipient=\"Bob\" data-ratio=\"0.2\">\r\n    <meta name=\"microtip\" content=\"1DCzzFuW33YJv9RGUMHyvgaoTdcNkwGMeR\" data-recipient=\"Terry\" data-ratio=\"0.8\">\r\n\r\nTo see some pages with these meta tags, checkout these test pages (all addreses belong to the Autotip project)\r\n\r\n* [Multiple addresses](http://priestc.github.io/Autotip/test_double.html)\r\n* [Altcoin tip address](http://priestc.github.io/Autotip/test_altcoin.html)\r\n\r\n## APIs used\r\n\r\nThis extension uses the following APIs:\r\n\r\n* [Bitcore](http://bitcore.io) - creating transactions, generating the deposit address\r\n* [Blockr.io](http://blockr.io) - getting unspent outputs, pushing raw transaction to the network\r\n* [Winkdex](https://winkdex.com) - getting current exchange rate\r\n* [Blockchain.info](http://blockchain.info) - getting balance of an address.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
