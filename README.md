## Website owners who would like to receive tips

Add a microtip meta tag to your page (anywhere in the `head` or `body` of the document):

    <meta name="microtip" content="1HWpyFJ7N6rvFkq3ZCMiFnqM6hviNFmG5X" data-currency='btc'>

Replace the value of `content` with your bitcoin address.

You can also use altcoin addresses:

    <meta name="microtip" content="Lb78JDGxMcih1gs3AirMeRW6jaG5V9hwFZ" data-currency='ltc'>

Currently, this extension does not support any altcoins, but support is planned.
