# Autotip

Autotip is:

* A decentralized cryptocurrency microtipping platform.
* Currently there is only one plugin supporting the autotip protocol: An Open source Google Chrome extension.
* All tips move directly from tipper to tipee with no middleman (other than the bitcoin network). No account required.
* Alternate way for content creators (bloggers, forums posters, artists) to monetize their content.
* HTML5 standards compliant (official inclusion to the HTML standard is [pending](https://github.com/priestc/Autotip/issues/1)).
* A system where you can receive Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Dogecoin, Litecoin and many others.
